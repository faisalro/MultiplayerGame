Feature 1:
    Touch controls for the game

Feature 2:
    In order to pick up ammo one must come near a crate and tilt the device (landscape orientation)
    so that its flat and then bring it back up enough to pick up ammo.

Please Note:
    Due to issues deploying on the 142.1.200.14x server (unable to install node_modules as posted on myBB).
    Our group was forced to test the mobile features on our laptops (which happened to be touch screen
    and had accelerometer) and simulate the screen ratio. The app was tested on chrome and simulated iPad
    screen ratio (1024x768) landscape mode.
